# Create redis user and set password
FROM redis:8.0
# Expose the Redis port

# Copy the redis configuration file to the Docker image
# COPY redis.conf /usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
# Start Redis server with the specified configuration file
# CMD ["redis-server", "/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf"]
# The configuration file should contain the necessary settings, including the password.
# Example redis.conf content:
# requirepass YourStrongPassword
# This will set the password for Redis to "YourStrongPassword".
# Make sure to create the redis.conf file with the necessary configuration settings.
# You can also add other configuration settings as needed.
# The Redis server will start with the specified configuration when the container is run.
# The configuration file can include various settings such as:
# bind
# port 6379
# maxmemory 256mb
# maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
# and many others as per your requirements.
# Refer to the official Redis documentation for more configuration options:
# https://redis.io/topics/config
# The CMD instruction overrides the default command of the base image.
# Ensure that the redis.conf file is in the same directory as this Dockerfile when building the image.
